# Learning about Machine Learning

## What
This repository contains machine learning examples.
The examples can be opened with Jupyter notebook (https://jupyter.org/) and the code is written in Python.

## Why
1. Machine Learning (and AI) is very popular at the moment. I want to get a better feel for what it is.
2. I believe machine learning can be fun to play around with. It contains many for me new tools and interesting concepts.
3. I get to practice writing Python code (since Python is one of the most popular langauges in machine learning).
